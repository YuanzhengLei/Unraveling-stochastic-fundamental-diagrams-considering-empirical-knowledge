This code repository includes the source code for the :

```
Unraveling stochastic fundamental diagrams considering empirical knowledge: modeling, limitation and further discussion
Yuan-Zheng Lei, Yaobang Gong, and Xianfeng Terry Yang
```

The experimentation framework is based on TensorFlow; 

This repo includes more than the implementation of the paper. It implements both single-regime and multi-regime fundamental diagram models as the prior of the non-parametric stochastic fundamental diagram model. All experiments are reproduced. For details, please see the comments.

# Requirements and References
The code uses the following Python packages, and they are required: ``tensorflow, gpflow, numpy, scipy``

The code is only tested in ``Python 3`` using ``Anaconda`` environment.

We adapt and use some code snippets from:
* [WLSM for single-regime fundamental diagram models](https://github.com/YuanzhengLei/Weighted-the-least-square-method-for-single-regime-fundamental-diagram-models)



# Usage
To train a model, run 'EPGPR_Model.py'.
